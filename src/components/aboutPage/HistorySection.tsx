          The Vision of The Father&apos;s House started in the place of prayer at a time
          in January 2003. Apostle Richard Udoh had just resigned from an executive
          position in one of the leading new generation banks in Nigeria with the sole
          intention to run a full time ministerial assignment with The Foursquare Gospel
          Church, Saabo, Lagos.
        </p>
        <p>
          From January 1st 2003, he began to seek the face of the Lord for direction in
          full time ministry. As he prayed, a word came clearly from the Lord that he
          should start an independent ministry. This was quite unexpected and incredible
          to him because he went to pray with the mindset of a ministry in The Foursquare
          Gospel Church in Nigeria but God began to point him in another direction
          entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          He promptly shared this with his wife, who at that time felt he should focus on
          the work at hand without plunging into something new. He kept praying and also
          requested that God should convince her. Then came August 2003, after a series of
          prayers, she became convinced and moves were made for proper and procedural
          exiting of the organization he was serving in at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having received the full permission of the then General Overseer of The
          Foursquare Gospel Church to leave, he handed over the Pastorate of Saabo
          Foursquare Gospel Church to a new Pastor on December 28th 2003 and began
          preparations for the commencement of the new ministry, The Manifest Ministry.
          December 2003 marked a turning point in his ministry and life. First, it marked
          the end of his service in the Foursquare movement and secondly, the beginning of
          an independent ministry, The Manifest Ministry ordained by God, of which
          church&apos;s arm is The Father&apos;s House.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maiden service of The Father&apos;s House was a crossover service on
          December 31st, 2003 held at 28, Bola Oshikoya Street, Alagbole. The service
          attracted all those who had heard about the new spiritual initiative and made
          enquiries to know its location. A total of 58 worshippers (adult and children)
          attended the inaugural service.
        </p>

          After the maiden edition, subsequent services in January were held at the same
          venue until God provided a landed property at 90, Ojodu-Akute Road. The church
          moved there in February 2004 and ever since the Lord has built for Himself a
          befitting worship sanctuary with a modern office complex. God has been so
          faithful.
        </p>
        <p>
          As at July 2011, The Father&apos;s House had planted seven other branches around
          the nation and is planning to do more by the grace of God. To God be the glory,
          great things He has done for us.
